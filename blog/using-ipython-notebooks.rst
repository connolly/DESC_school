Each post here is an ipython notebook. To view a static version of the
notebook - with the code and figures embedded - simply click on the
title of the post or on  "Read more...".

To download the notebook to your machine, click  the title of the post and
then on "Source"  which you can find in the top right corner and save the notebook to
your harddrive.

To run the notebook - assuming you have followed the installation
instructions - simply type in the directory where you saved the notebook,

   ipython notebook [notebook_name.ipynb] 

or 

   jupyter notebook  [notebook_name.ipynb] 

depending on the version of ipython that is installed on your
machine. This should bring up a page in your browser with the notebook

shift-enter - on a mac - in each cell in the notebook will execute the
code in that cell

To prepare for the class, check that you can download and running the "Histograms" notebook below to make sure everything is installed correctly
